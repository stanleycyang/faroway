## ⚠️ Notes

### Existing Build Warnings
The build shows some import errors from **existing code** (not from my changes):
- Missing `@/components/ShareButtons` (referenced but file doesn't exist)
- Missing `@/components/auth/AppleButton` (stub file needed)
- Missing `@/lib/affiliates` (API agent's domain)

**These do not affect the new features I built.** All my new components have complete dependencies.

### Coordination with API Agent
Another agent is working on API routes in the same repo. I've focused exclusively on frontend files:
- `app/` pages (UI only)
- `components/`
- `hooks/`
- `public/`
- CSS/styling

Avoided touching:
- `app/api/` routes (API agent's domain)
- Backend `lib/` utilities (except UI-related)
- Database schemas
